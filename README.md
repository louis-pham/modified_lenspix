# modified_lenspix
---very much a WIP---
original code found at: http://cosmologist.info/lenspix/

kappa2phi.py - reads in kappa map and converts to phi map

showmaps.py - displays unlensed/lensed maps, and optionally kappa,phi,diff maps

Simlens.f90 - modified to read in external unlensed map and a phi map

params.ini - nside/lmax should match the nside/lmax of the input primary and phi map
